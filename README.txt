or create your own. 
Each questions in a survey has the option to require a text answer or contain different check box
options.

This project uses a local database using MySQL.
It is made using the MVC architecture separating the Model, Views and Controllers.
All methods are tested using UnitTesting and Asserting

You won't be able to log in or create an account, but it is made easier to run both views by switching
the code in the main class (Program.cs)
